Often mortgage companies get tons of PDFs from clients and many hours are spent
by staff to go through all these documents and file them accordingly.  The
motivation behind this project was to develop a model using machine learning
techniques that would be able to analyze the text from these PDFs and classify
them.  In doing so, employees would not have to open each document and read
through them to determine how they should be filed.  This would save both time 
and money for the company, and allow employees to work on other tasks integral
to running their business.
